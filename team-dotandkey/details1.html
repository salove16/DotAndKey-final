<p>Is melatonin the answer to your sleep problems? Probably!</p>
<br>
<p>Sleeplessness is not uncommon these days! If you have been experiencing sleepless nights or a disturbed sleep cycle, this blog might help you. In this article, we will find out what is melatonin and the importance of melatonin for sleep. </p>
<br>
<h3>What is melatonin? </h3>
<br>
<p>To simply put, melatonin is a hormone that is naturally produced by the pineal gland of the brain. Melatonin is responsible for regulating the circadian rhythm, which tells our body when to rest. In other words, it’s the hormone that makes us sleepy.

 

  Our brain naturally produces more melatonin as night falls. During the day, melatonin secretion is reduced as we start waking up. So, it is melatonin that helps maintain our sleep cycle and the biological sleep-wake rhythm. 
  
   
  
  Did you know that melatonin production is regulated by the sun and light? As the sun sets, our brain starts to produce melatonin, which usually happens around 9 PM. Melatonin production is highest between 2 AM and 4 AM, which is why doctors and health experts advise us to hit the sack early.
  
   
  
  As discussed in our previous blog, exposure to interior lights and blue lights from phone screens can affect our melatonin secretion at night. Blue lights from phone screens suppress our melatonin production, making us feel less sleepy!  If you are trying to sleep better, it is crucial to keep away from gadgets and dim the lights.</p>
  
  <h3>Melatonin supplements for better sleep</h3>
  <p>Some individuals experience less melatonin production due to increased stress, anxiety and a variety of other reasons. As we have already discussed, melatonin is responsible for helping us sleep. The brain usually makes only 0.2 milligrams of melatonin which might not be enough for some people for a good night’s rest.

 

    Like any other health supplements, melatonin supplements are recommended for people having trouble falling asleep. There are no harmful side effects of melatonin supplements and, they can be safely administered for insomniacs. 
    
     
    
    Melatonin supplements like IKWI  are enriched with melatonin and natural ingredient like valerian root to help you sleep better. These are non-addictive, thin oral mint strips with no harmful side effects, ideal for everyday use. The meltables work by promoting a healthy sleep cycle and readjusting the internal clock to help you sleep faster. It is also great for those experiencing jet lag!</p>
  
  <h3>Is it safe to take melatonin long-term?</h3>
  <p>Although melatonin is safe for regular use, there are fewer published reports on its long-term usage. Also, it is probably best to avoid melatonin supplements if you are pregnant or breastfeeding or suffering from an autoimmune disease.</p>
  <h3>How much melatonin is too much?</h3>
  <p>Most doctors recommend taking smaller doses ranging from 1 to 5 milligrams every night. Sleep supplements like the IKWI Snooze Pro Meltables are enriched with the right amount of melatonin, making it safer for you to consume every night. The recommended dosage for IKWI Snooze Pro Meltables is 1 strip per day.

                                                                                                                                              

    It is also advisable to not pop melatonin throughout the day! Instead of working against your natural melatonin, use the supplement to reinforce your natural melatonin production. It’s best to pop a gummy or meltable 1 hour or 30 minutes before sleeping.</p>

    <h3>Melatonin in food</h3>
    <p>Several Indian food items are rich in melatonin. Do you ever wonder why you feel sleepy post the afternoon meal of rice and veggies? Well, rice is rich in melatonin.

 

      Other food items are bananas, oats, oranges, pineapple and ginger. Even walnuts and almonds have melatonin and also make for great midnight snacks. 
      
       
      
      So to answer your question, can melatonin be taken every night- yes! </p>
